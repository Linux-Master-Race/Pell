* Make sure all commit messages are sensical and descriptive
* Follow all the PEP guidelines (test [here](http://pep8online.com/) ) ([PEP8 doc [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))
* Comments: whitephoenix: code explains how, comments explain why and provide organization
  * Write good, descriptive comments of why the code is there, and if it is unclear what it does, explain it.
  * There should be absolutely no profane language in the comments.
  * I don't think we need a CoC for now, it's simple, be adults and don't be mean.
